# inject-timer
Locally hosted, sortable web timer for organization of CCDC Injects.

## Proposed use:
1. The timer web server (node.js planned) is spun up on localhost.
2. The web frontend is brought up on the main display in front of the team, showing all timers and timers about to expire.
3. Team members can open up the frontend on their computer and select their (or team members') names from the drop down to see those respective timers.
